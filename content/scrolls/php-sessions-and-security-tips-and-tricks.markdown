And now: 30 seconds o' fun:

## Misc notes
* take MD5 of USER_AGENT into account (and possibly other HTTP headers) -- changing of it between sessions may be possible hijack
* use cookies as extra security level (put fingerprint into cookie)
	* Store md5 of sid, ip, login time into cookie and into db table to compare them later
* use prevention of logging into existing session -- always generate new session ID after login.
* try to issue session id only after successful authentication
* take note of IP-verifying. Some proxies may change your IP. However, you can limit it to C-class network.
* SSL is your friend

## Other issues in PHP

* enabled transparent SID may cause problems with HTTP Content-length
* definition of classes stored in session must be included prior to starting session (beware of auto_start)
